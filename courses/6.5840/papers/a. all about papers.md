读分布式的文章是有难度的, 
对此, gpt 给出的建议是:

1. Start with the abstract and introduction: focus on paper's motivation, objectives, and contribution --> context and relevance
2. Understand the problem and motivations: pay attention to the problem statement and the specific challenges the paper aims to address --> significance and purpose of design
3. Study the system design or algorithm: focus on the main section --> understand the concepts, assumptions, and mechanisms used
4. Analyze diagrams, figures, and examples: fully understand the key system components, data flows, protocol interactions and work through the examples step-by-step --> deeper understanding
5. Take notes and ask questions!
