[406. 根据身高重建队列](https://leetcode.cn/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

思路: TODO

```go
func reconstructQueue(people [][]int) [][]int {
	quickSort(people, 0, len(people)-1)
	fmt.Printf("after sort: %v\n", people)

	for i, p := range people {
		newPos := p[1]
		copy(people[newPos+1:i+1], people[newPos:i+1])
		people[newPos] = p
	}
	return people
}

func quickSort(people [][]int, low, high int) {
	if high > low {
		mid := partition(people, low, high)
		quickSort(people, low, mid-1)
		quickSort(people, mid+1, high)
	}
}

func partition(people [][]int, low, high int) int {
	pivot := people[high][0]
	pivotCount := people[high][1]
	i := low - 1

	for j := low; j < high; j++ {
		if people[j][0] > pivot || (people[j][0] == pivot && people[j][1] < pivotCount) {
			i += 1
			people[i], people[j] = people[j], people[i]
		}
	}

	i += 1
	people[i], people[high] = people[high], people[i]
	return i
}
