[172. 阶乘后的零](https://leetcode.cn/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)


### Idea
- Every trailing zero comes from `10`, while `10` could be divided into `2*5`
- Since `2` is much more than `5`, so once we figure out how many `5s` the given number could be divided into, we could calculate how many trailing zeros of that number
- TODO


### Code
```go
func trailingZeroes(n int) int {
	ret := 0
	for n > 0 {
		n /= 5
		ret += n
	}

	return ret
}
```
